# TODO-list-app
I will create a todo-list web application that will be able to add, delete, and edit the tasks. Will look to create it with maximum functionality!!


The first version of the web application will have the functionality of adding and deleting tasks on the list.
In the future i plan to add the edit functionality also.
Also currently there is only one theme for the TODO list (Pikachu theme), I plan to add more themes in Pokemon style (Charizard, Squirtle, Rayquaza etc..).
The purpose of the list is to have an entertaining task tracker that will be fun and simple.
It can be used by kids and/or adults.
Currently there are no sound effects when you add and remove tasks but I plan to add that in the next version update also.
